# ESP-32 Drone üõ∏
ESP-32 Drone is an open-source light weight and compact drone with extended IO's for adding multiple sensors.

# Hardware ‚öôÔ∏è

## Designs

Requires advanced soldering experience to build - reflow and/or small-pitch surface-mount soldering are required, and assembly is quite time-consuming and delicate.

Not recommended for general use yet (mechanical and electrical revisions are planned).

# Heading

 - 240x240 round LCD, protected by 39.5mm watch glass on rotor
 - Low cost BLDC gimbal motor, with a hollow shaft for mechanically & electrically connecting the LCD
 - Powered by ESP32-PICO-V3-02 (Lilygo TMicro32 Plus module)
 - PCB flexure and strain gauges used for press detection (haptic feedback provided via the motor)
 - 8 side-firing RGB LEDs (SK6812-SIDE-A) illuminate ring around the knob
